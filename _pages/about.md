I'm a Machine Learning Researcher at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/) working on improving agentic and retrieval-augmented workflows with Large Language Models (LLMs). My research interests are in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Recently, I have been interested in evaluation frameworks, structured prediction, and efficiency in LLMs.    

Previously, I was an Applied scientist intern at [Amazon Alexa AI - NLU](https://www.amazon.science/tag/alexa) and an Analyst at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/). I was supervised by [Prof. Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/) during my grad school at [UMass NLP](https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/). I also did my Bachelor's in Computer Science at [Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/), where I worked on Bayesian Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing with [Prof. Srijith P.K.](https://sites.google.com/site/pksrijith/home).
